In order to assess the performance of the memory-bound PT CUDA C implementation on NVIDIA Tesla V100 SXM2 GPU (16GB DRAM) and a Ampere A100 SXM4 (80GB DRAM) we employ the **effective memory throughput** metric.

We compared the effective memory throughput with the peak, i.e. the memory transfer speed for performing memory copy operations only. It represents the hardware performance limit. The code [`memcopy.cu`](/scripts/memcopy.cu) located in the [scripts](/scripts) directory reports the peak memory throughput. The reported peak memory throughput for the GPU hardware NVIDIA Tesla V100 and NVIDIA A100 were 785 GB/s and 1536 GB/s respectively.
